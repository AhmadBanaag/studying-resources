# 📚 WELCOME TO MY STUDYING RESOURCES

This is where I store **SOME study videos I’ve used for learning**.

This repository exists to be a **personal learning system**, not a playlist dump.

## 🎯 Purpose of this REPO

Most people tent to watch tutorial or finish a course and go on with their day.
But not for me, this repo was created to showcase videos that contributed to my growth.
